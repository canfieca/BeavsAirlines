Welcome to Beaver Airlines!

The goal of this project was to create a website that provides a
nice UI for a user to interact with our mySQL database. 

To run the website:

    1. Clone this repo into a directory on the ENGR server
    2. Install npm dependencies:
        npm i --save express mysql handlebars express-handlebars body-parser forever
    3. Run this command:
        node app.js
    4. Copy the URL that was printed to your terminal, and paste it in your browser

That's it! Hope you enjoy playing around with our database manager, Beaver Airlines!
